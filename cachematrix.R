## Set of functions that can handle the caching of the inverted (solved) value
## of a matrix in order to avoid the overhead of repeated calculations

## Creates a wrapper for a matrix with cached inverted (solved) value

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        s <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                s <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() s
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setsolve = setsolve,
             getsolve = getsolve)
}



## Gets the cached inverted (solved) value for the matrix or calculates and caches a fresh one

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        s <- x$getsolve()
        if (!is.null(s)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(s)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        s <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setsolve(s)
        s
